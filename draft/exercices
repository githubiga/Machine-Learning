Certainly! Here's a beginner-level supervised learning exercise that you can suggest to your students:

**Exercise: Classifying Iris Flowers with a Decision Tree**

**Objective:** In this exercise, your students will build a simple supervised learning model to classify Iris flowers into three different species based on their petal and sepal characteristics. This is a classic beginner's exercise using the Iris dataset.

**Dataset:** You'll use the Iris dataset, which includes measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for 150 Iris flowers, along with their corresponding species labels (setosa, versicolor, or virginica).

**Instructions:**

1. Load the Iris dataset. You can use Scikit-learn to load the dataset.

2. Explore the dataset:
   - Display the first few rows to understand the data's structure.
   - Check for any missing values.

3. Preprocess the data:
   - Split the dataset into features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and the target variable (species).
   - Encode the categorical target variable into numerical values (e.g., setosa=0, versicolor=1, virginica=2).

4. Split the data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).

5. Choose a simple classification algorithm for beginners, like a Decision Tree or a k-Nearest Neighbors classifier.

6. Train the model using the training data.

7. Make predictions on the test data.

8. Evaluate the model's performance using a basic metric like accuracy. Calculate the accuracy of the model's predictions on the test data.

9. Visualize the Decision Tree: If you've chosen a Decision Tree, you can visualize it to see how the model makes decisions based on the features.

10. Experiment with different algorithms: Encourage your students to try other algorithms such as k-Nearest Neighbors and see how they perform in comparison to the Decision Tree.

11. Discuss the results: Have your students reflect on the model's performance and limitations. Ask them to consider how they can improve the accuracy of the model.

This exercise is ideal for beginners to get hands-on experience with supervised learning and classification using a well-known and straightforward dataset. It introduces basic concepts like data exploration, preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation in a beginner-friendly manner.

Certainly! Here's a step-by-step correction for the beginner-level exercise on classifying Iris flowers using a Decision Tree. You can use this as a reference to check your students' work:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

# Step 1: Load the Iris dataset
iris = load_iris()

# Step 2: Explore and preprocess the data
# Display the first few rows of the dataset
iris_df = pd.DataFrame(data=np.c_[iris['data'], iris['target']], columns=iris['feature_names'] + ['target'])
print(iris_df.head())

# Check for missing values (in this case, the dataset is usually clean)
print(iris_df.isnull().sum())

# Step 3: Preprocess the data
X = iris.data
y = iris.target

# Step 4: Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Step 5: Choose a simple classification algorithm (Decision Tree)
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()

# Step 6: Train the model using the training data
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 7: Make predictions on the test data
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Step 8: Evaluate the model's performance
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')

# Step 9: Visualize the Decision Tree
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
from sklearn.tree import plot_tree
plot_tree(clf, filled=True, feature_names=iris.feature_names, class_names=iris.target_names)
plt.show()

# Step 10: Experiment with different algorithms (e.g., k-Nearest Neighbors)

Certainly! Here's an exercise using k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) for classification with the Iris dataset, following the steps you've outlined:

**Exercise: k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) Classification with the Iris Dataset**

**Objective:** The goal of this exercise is to use the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to classify Iris flowers based on their features.

**Instructions:**

1. Load the Iris dataset and store it in a variable named `iris`.

2. Display the features and their corresponding feature names. This will help students understand the dataset's structure and features.

3. Display the first ten samples (rows) of the dataset, which will give an initial overview of the data.

4. Perform the following steps to complete the exercise:

   a. Split the dataset into features (X) and the target variable (y).
   
   b. Split the data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).

   c. Choose the k-NN algorithm and train the model using the training data.

   d. Make predictions on the test data.

   e. Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy or other relevant classification metrics.

   f. Experiment with different values of 'k' to see how it affects the model's performance.

   g. Visualize the results, such as the decision boundary for different 'k' values.

5. Encourage students to discuss their findings, including the impact of different 'k' values on the model's performance and any potential challenges they encountered.

By following these steps, students will gain hands-on experience with the k-NN classification algorithm using a well-known dataset. It will help them understand the importance of feature exploration and data visualization in the context of classification tasks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Certainly, here's the corrected code for the exercise using k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classification with the Iris dataset:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Step 1: Load the Iris dataset
iris = load_iris()

# Step 2: Display the features and feature names
print("Features:\n", iris.data)
print("Feature Names:\n", iris.feature_names)

# Step 3: Display the first ten samples
iris_df = pd.DataFrame(data=iris.data, columns=iris.feature_names)
print("First Ten Samples:\n", iris_df.head(10))

# Step 4: Perform the classification steps

# a. Split the dataset into features (X) and the target variable (y)
X = iris.data
y = iris.target

# b. Split the data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# c. Choose the k-NN algorithm (k=3) and train the model using the training data
k = 3
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=k)
knn.fit(X_train, y_train)

# d. Make predictions on the test data
y_pred = knn.predict(X_test)

# e. Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')

# f. Experiment with different values of 'k'
# for k in range(1, 10):
#     knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=k)
#     knn.fit(X_train, y_train)
#     y_pred = knn.predict(X_test)
#     accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
#     print(f'Accuracy for k={k}: {accuracy}')

# g. Visualize the results (decision boundary, if desired)
```

In this code, we first load the Iris dataset, display its features and feature names, and show the first ten samples. Then, we perform k-NN classification using a specified value of 'k' (in this case, k=3) and calculate the accuracy of the model. You can experiment with different 'k' values as indicated in step 4f to see how it affects the model's performance. The visualization part (step 4g) can be added if you want to create visualizations of the decision boundary for different 'k' values.
