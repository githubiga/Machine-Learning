Java is a high-level object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle). It is designed to be platform-independent, meaning that Java programs can run on any device or operating system that has a Java Virtual Machine installed. It is widely used in web development, mobile application development, enterprise applications, and other domains. Java's syntax is similar to C++, making it relatively easy for developers to learn if they are familiar with other programming languages.
